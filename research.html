								<p>In 1967, Dan Janzen proposed a profound mechanism that could explain the high species richness in tropical mountains, known as the “mountain passes are higher in the tropics” hypothesis. Since its description, a large number of studies have been corroborating assumptions associated with this process. However, the vast majority of studies focused on comparisons of highly divergent lineages, occurring in contrasting latitudes, observing the effects of climate variability in space over deep evolutionary time frames. Using genome-wide markers from populations of 21 species, climatic modeling, and statistical modeling we were able to demonstrate that species’ tropical populations are under greater ecological constraints and thus have undergone greater genomic differentiation than their populations in subtropical areas. These findings support the main assumptions of Janzen’s hypothesis and show the phenomenon is observable at a very early stage of the speciation process and small spatial scale. By focusing on the microevolutionary scale, we were able to exclude the noise generated by time, which leads populations to diverge in their traits and history and infer that adaptation to local climate might be one of the first processes to operate in driving the contrasting diversity patterns across latitude. Our results provide clear evidence for how a narrow latitudinal gradient can shape microevolutionary processes and contribute to broader scale biodiversity patterns. </p>

								<p>Montane organisms responded to Quaternary climate change by tracking suitable habitat along elevational gradients. However, it is unclear whether these past climatic dynamics generated predictable patterns of genetic diversity in co-occurring montane taxa. We integrated paleoclimatic data and a model selection approach based on a machine learning algorithm for testing the demographic history of five co-distributed bird species occurring in the southern Atlantic Forest sky islands. Our results suggest that the heterogeneous distribution of genetic variation in birds of the Atlantic Forest sky islands is associated with the interplay between topography and climate of distinct mountains, leading to specific patterns of genetic diversity that can be used to predict future responses to climate change. </p>

								<p>The role of climate as a speciation driver in the Amazon has long been discussed. Phylogeographic approaches did not recover consistent demographic oscillations, not supporting conclusive evidence on the role of climatic changes in promoting diversification in the Amazon. We conducted a comparative phylogenomic analysis of floodplain forest birds to explore the effects of historical environmental changes and current connectivity on population differentiation. Our data suggest that changes in the fluvial landscape induced by climate variation during the Mid- and Late Pleistocene drove population isolation, leading to diversification with subsequent secondary contact. These results provided one of the most substantial pieces of evidence to date supporting that climatic oscillations are intimately linked to genetic differentiation in the Amazon. </p>

								<p> In this study, we used an integrative approach, including genomic data, mitochondrial DNA Sanger sequencing, and morphological data to investigate species limits and phylogenetic relationships in the face of gene flow in an Amazonian endemic species (Myrmoborus lugubris: Aves). Before populations become independent evolutionary lineages, the effects of microevolutionary processes tend to generate complex scenarios of diversification that may affect phylogenetic reconstruction. Not accounting for gene flow in species tree estimates can directly impact topology, effective population sizes, and branch lengths, and the resulting estimation errors are still poorly understood in wild populations. Our results demonstrated that failing to account for gene flow when estimating phylogenies at shallow divergence levels can generate topological uncertainty, which can nevertheless be statistically well supported, and that model testing approaches using simulated data can be useful tools to test alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. </p>

								<p> Establishing links between phenotypic and genotypic variation is a central goal of evolutionary biology, as they might provide valuable insights into evolutionary processes shaping genetic and species diversity in nature. One of the more intriguing possibilities is when no genetic divergence is found to be associated with conspicuous phenotypic change. However, a finding of phenotypic distinctiveness with weak or no population genetic structure may simply result from low statistical power to detect shallow genetic divergences when small data sets are used. Here, we used a genomic data set to explore genome-wide divergence between two species of Antilophia manakins, which are phenotypically distinct yet lack strong genetic differentiation. Our results revealed a clear population structure that matches the two phenotypes, supporting the idea that smaller data sets lacked the power to detect recent divergence events. One implication of our study is that genomic data sets are necessary to help redefine local conservation programs by revealing cryptic population structure that may be key to population management. </p>

								<p>Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic processes affect the genetic diversity across organisms' genomes. Mutation, recombination, genetic drift and migration operate simultaneously and heterogeneously across the genome and will directly interfere on our ability to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among species. With the progressive decrease in the costs to obtain large amounts of data for non-model organisms, phylogenomic approaches have typically analyzed thousands of markers, revealing high heterogeneity in phylogenetic signals across the genome (citations). Here we examine how phylogenetic information is distributed across the genome of three Amazonia bird lineages in order to explore how different processes affect patterns of species relationship across the genome. </p>
